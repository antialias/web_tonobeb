HOW TO PLAY TONOBEB<br>
<br>
EQIPMENT<br>
<br>
7 x 14 playing board<br>
About 16 dice of two different colors. (Only 12 dice are needed to begin the game, but as pieces are captured, they will need to be replaced with one's own color.)<br>
OBJECT<br>
To eliminate all of your opponent's pieces or pursuade him to concede. A player who falls three or more pieces behind his opponent has little hope of winning.<br>
SET UP<br>
The board is oriented the long way between the two players. Each player's pieces are placed on the squares along the edge of the board to his left. The six dice are lined up with numbers showing in descending order, starting with a six in the corner. Thus each player begins the game with one die of each denomination. (<a href = 'photo1.tif'>See photo # 1</a>.)<br>
<br>
MOVEMENT<br>
<br>
Every one of a player's pieces must move each turn. Pieces move in a straight line either horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally. The number shown on each die determines the number of spaces it can move. If the player chooses, pieces may be moved one more or one less than the number shown. If this is done, the die's number is then changed to the number of spaces moved. For instance, if a four is moved three spaces, it then becomes a three and on the next move it can be moved two, three, or four spaces, and so on. Thus, the number shown on each piece represents the number of spaces moved during the previous turn. Exceptions: A one may "move" zero spaces, but it still remains a one; a six however, may not move seven spaces.<br>
Pieces cannot move "through" or "over" other pieces, be they one's own or one's opponent's. Since all pieces must move at least one less than their current number, pieces are sometimes blocked from proceeding in a desired direction. Thus in fig. A, if the two moves horizontally one or two spaces, then the five will not be able to move horizontally also. However, if the two moves horizontally three spaces, then the five may follow it by moving four spaces. If the two moves vertically, then nothing prevents the five from passing through the space where the two had been, even though both moves occur in the same turn.<br>

ELIMINATING OPPONENT'S PIECES -- THREE METHODS<br>
<br>
1. Destroying. A piece may land on a square occupied by an opponent's piece. The opponent's piece is then removed from the board.<br>
2. Capturing. A player may place two of his pieces on squares horizontally and/or vertically adjacent to an opponent's piece and then replace that piece with one of his own color. The captured piece retains its number. The newly captured piece may not be moved until the next turn. Capturing may not be done using unmoved pieces; that is, if a player happens to place a piece adjacent to two of his opponent's pieces, then that piece will not be captured, because his opponent has not yet moved and will probably have to move his pieces away (unless they are ones). Each capture requires the use of two different pieces; i.e., a die being used to capture one piece cannot participate in the capture of another adjacent piece. So in fig. B, where red has just finished moving, the red two may be used in combination with the red three to capture the blue one or in combination with the red five to capture the blue four, but not both. The red player must decide which piece he wants to capture.<br><br>

<br>
In effecting a capture, attacking pieces are allowed to destroy other pieces at the same time. Thus in fig. C, the red one may move to square 2-B and destroy the blue four. Then if the red three moves to square 1-A, the blue five will be captured.<br>

3. Fourwalling. A piece blocked from moving its minimum required number of spaces in all four directions is said to be "fourwalled." This may be accomplished by placing one's own pieces in an opponent's piece's path. The edges of the playing board are considered "walls," so a piece may be fourwalled by as few as two other pieces. A fourwalled piece is eliminated from play. In practice, fourwalling is the least common method of elimination.<br>
Note: Opportunities to capture, destroy, or fourwall do not oblige a player to do so.<br />
