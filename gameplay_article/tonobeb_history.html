<br>In my adolescence I was an enthusiastic player of board games. I even used to invent them. But then I grew up and became absorbed in other things -- like being a parent. Well, as any parent knows, children have a way of rekindling old interests for us.
<br>One Saturday morning my five-year-old daughter awoke before I did and quietly began to occupy herself with her crayons and paper. I was lazing half-awake in my bed and didn't know what she was doing -- just peacefully entertaining herself was all that I supposed. When I finally wandered into the kitchen where she was working at the table, she greeted me with a self-satisfied smile and asked if I'd like to play her game.
<br>"Game?" The word prodded me into another stage of wakefulness. "What game?"
<br>"Right here. I made it. Do you want to play?"
<br>"You made a game? What's it called?"
<br>She pointed to some letters she 'd written at the edge of the paper:
<br><br>T-O-N-O-B-E-B. Being a kindergartener, she knew letters, but did not quite understand how to combine their sounds into words. She had simply written down some of her favorite letters. In this case they just happened to form something pronounceable.
<br><br>"Tonobeb?" I asked, awkwardly piecing together the sounds.
<br><br>"Yeah," she replied with exuberant confidence, as if she already knew how to pronounce it.
<br><br>"Tonobeb?" I scratched my sleepy head. "Okay, I'll play tonobeb with you. How do you play?"
<br><br>Her grasp of gaming was about as firm as her grasp of spelling, but in me something very old was beginning to stir. On the paper she had drawn some circles of various colors connected by haphazard lines. For the moving pieces of her game she had found among her loose toys several dice of two different colors. She told me that the white ones were mine and the green ones were hers.
<br><br>"Alright, you go first and show me how it's done."
<br><br>"Okay," she said, and taking one of her dice, she counted off four spaces, the number showing on the die. Then she moved another one three spaces and said, "Your turn."
<br><br>"I see." I nodded my head pensively, realizing that tonobeb was above all a game of innovation. With one of my dice, I counted off five lines and circles to land right beside one of her pieces.
<br><br>Something very interesting was happening here, but it took me a while to realize what it was. The only board games my daughter had ever played involved using dice to determine the number of spaces a player's token could move along a path. But here she was using the dice as the tokens themselves. Intriguing! Those six faces allowed each piece to have six different characteristics. This was an idea with potential.
<br><br>"Hey, this is fun!" I said as we came to an arbitrary finish to our game. "Now I want to make a game.",
<br><br>The possibilities presented by the die's six faces enchanted me. If each time a piece moved it could change its characteristics, then a new dimension might be added to abstract board gaming. The six numbered sides of the die provided a rather simple method of making any such changes -- far simpler than, say, substituting a different token each time a change was made. Besides, dice are readily available and have such a nice look and feel! Why hadn't this idea ever occured to me before? I guess I was just used to thinking of those spotted cubes in their traditional role of being rolled. It took the freshness of a child to see things otherwise.
<br><br>Anyway, forgetting breakfast, I got out a ruler and poster board and started drawing a grid. In the days and weeks that followed, tonobeb underwent several changes. My brother and I spent many enjoyable hours evolving the game into something totally different from its inspiration. The uneuphonious name, however, stuck.
<br><br>Tonobeb can take anywhere from twenty minutes to two hours to play, depending on how long the players consider each move. The necessity of moving all one's pieces each turn can be quite disconcerting at first, making the game seem unwieldy and chaotic. After a few games, however, one soon gets the feel of his pieces being an organic whole in a way that moving them one at a time would not allow. This feature combined with the unique characteristics of the pieces themselves and the various ways one can dispose of an opponent's pieces make tonobeb an endless source of fascination for me.</p>
