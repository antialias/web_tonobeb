<html><title>Tonobeb: playing hints</title><body>
<h1>PLAYING HINTS</h1>
<p>To prevent confusion as to which pieces have already been moved during your turn always cock each die diagonally after it has been moved so that you will be able to tell it from the ones you have not yet moved. (See photo # 2.) When your move is completed return all your pieces to their normal orientation. Also refrain from moving any pieces before you have decided how to move all your others.</p>
<p>High numbered pieces are a liability. They are hard to maneuver and easy for your opponent to fourwall. Thus your five and six should be reduced in the first few moves. Increase your other numbers only when necessary. Ones, twos, and threes are most useful. Ones and twos can never be fourwalled.</p>
<p>Entice your opponent by placing a piece of bait before him. Give him something tempting to capture or destroy. Of course you will keep the bait well protected so that when he pounces, you spring the trap. This ploy is as old as the game of chess, but in tonobeb it can turn the game into a whirlpool of death. With every piece moving every turn, the situation can change very swiftly. It is hard to set a foolproof trap.</p>
<p>If you have more pieces than your opponent, you can increase your advantage by "trading down." For example, if you have five and he has four pieces, it may be wise to sacrifice one of your pieces in an even trade, thus leaving you with four and him with three. You will still have only one piece more than he, but in percentages you will be better off. This is especially significant when you consider that all pieces are moved each turn, so in the example just mentioned you would end up with 33% more movement capability than he, whereas before you only had a 25% lead.</p>
<p>Don't think of one side of the board as being your territory. Sometimes it can be to your advantage to force your opponent to move some of his pieces "behind" your lines.</p>
<p>All the general admonitions concerning abstract board gaming apply to tonobeb. Think of your playing pieces as a unified whole working together. Try to see further ahead than your opponent.</p>
